# Android-Fiftygram
One of the many web development projects offered by HarvardX's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course.

This mobile app development project uses Java and Android Studio to upload images and apply filters onto those images. The examples shown below are examples of the filters applied (Sepia, Toon, and Sketch). Further filters will be applied to give the app more options/flexibility.

This was my second android app and my second attempt at coding in the Java Programming language. I feel I am adapting quite well to developing apps using Java, and am looking forward to developing more Java applications.
